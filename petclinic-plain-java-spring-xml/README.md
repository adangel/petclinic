# Pet Clinic with plain java and Spring XML for DI

Sample application [Pet Clinic](https://spring-petclinic.github.io/) from spring, but
written in plain Java with [Spring Framework](https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework) for DI.

## Goals

* Learn about what Java is capable of without Spring
* Learn about Inversion of Control (IoC) / Dependency Injection
  * We only use the core technology "dependency injection" from Spring
  * We use the XML-based configuration: `beans.xml`
  * Supported scopes are singleton (default) and prototype - see ownerController.

## Non-Goals

* This is not an example of how a modern WebApp should be built. It's only for learning purposes.
