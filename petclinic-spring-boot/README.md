# Pet Clinic with Spring Boot

Sample application [Pet Clinic](https://spring-petclinic.github.io/) from spring, 
rewritten using [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot).

## Goals

* Learn about what Spring is providing for such applications out of the box.
* Eg. JSON binding is supported by default.
* Note: OwnerController and @RequestScope option
* Configurations: DatabaseConfiguration, WebConfiguration - these are picked up automatically

## Non-Goals

* Note: We don't use a real database, we still use the simple Database class.
* This is not an example of how a modern WebApp should be built. It's only for learning purposes.
